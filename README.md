# MMDS_ML-Song-Genre-Classification
This research project evaluates the accuracy of 5 models in classifying songs into genres. Datasets were independently assembled from Spotify/YouTube playlists and an excerpt of the GTZAN dataset: [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification)

In this repo's .ipynb notebook file is a full breakdown of the performance and accuracy of two strategies: traditional models (random forest, decision tree, KNN, logistic regression) trained on Spotifyâ€™s acoustic/psychoacoustic parameters, against a Tensorflow/Keras CNN visually trained on song mel spectrograms.
